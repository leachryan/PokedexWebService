# PokedexWebService
A repo for my Pokedex Web Service

NOTE: This project is unfinished, with features planned but not implemented

HOW TO USE:
-This project works with the Pokedex Web Client, so this project must be run first
1) Download the project
2) Open the .sln file with Visual Studio
3) Under Debug, click Start Without Debugging
4) Minimize window. The service should be working. This can be seen by right clicking the IIS Express and seeing the project name under View Sites
5) Next step would be to run the client, which is explained in the PokedexWebClient repo
